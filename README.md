# Sums-of-Two-Sixth-Powers
# This is the repository that contains all of the code used in the paper "Integers that are sums of two rational sixth powers" by Alexis Newton and Jeremy Rouse.
# The authors can be contacted at alexis.newton@emory.edu and rouseja@wfu.edu, respectively.
# The paper can be found on the arXiv here: 
# This work represents joint work done when the first author was a masterâ€™s student at Wake Forest University. Computations were done in Magma version 2.26-9 on a desktop with an Intel i9-11900K CPU and 128 GB of RAM.
# All the steps combine to form a proof that 164634913 is the smallest integer that is a sum of two rational sixth powers but not a sum of two integer sixth powers.
